			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I see you found clothes to wear that form a nice addition to your store.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1007">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>To be honest, I wear these clothes also outside work hours. They are my outfit day and night.</Text>

			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>You see, I used to be a circus clown for many years. I think this line of work thoroughly affects you. Once a clown, forever a clown... always.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1010">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>So you're a clown?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1011">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>I used to work at the Jolly Fair. Even though those days are not over, I am still a clown by heart.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1012">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>And that’s not all: I might not be performing anymore, but I still want to reach out to my fellow buffoons and support their cause. Especially in these dark days clowns are very important.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1013">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>You take your former profession still very seriously!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1014">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Of course I do! Those were my best years. Success smiled upon me. The audience knew how to value my clownsmanship.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1015">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>What happened?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1016">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Och, didn’t you know that the Jolly Fair went bankrupt a long time ago? With the public, we clowns abandoned the place as well.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>

		<SpokenLine ID="1017">

		<SpokenLine ID="1018">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>Hey, is that a real lute that you got there?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1019">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>That thing? Of course boy, never seen one before?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1020">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I mean, is it playable?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1021">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>What do you mean is it playable? It's a lute, isn't it?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1022">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>Oh that could be exactly what I need!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1023">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>You need a lute? Honestly, that thing is just getting in the way. I guess you can take it if you want to.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1923">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>That is such good news! I feared I wouldn't be able to find a musical instrument.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1024">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Wait a minute, what do you need this lute for?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1025">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I am a collector of instruments for the Outside-In Art Gallery. Your lute would greatly enhance our collection.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1026">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I need a lute to play my devestating songs that will overthrow an evil conspiracy at the Royal Court!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1027">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I want to bring an ode to Olivia, my secret love. I need the lute to accompany me and obscure my failing voice.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1028">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>No, of course I don’t need this lute. But your lute might be infected by vicious woodworm. I love your shop and want to take the lute in order to prevent the worms from eating your precious costumes.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1029">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Oh.. well.. in that case… Unfortunately I can’t give it to you. The lute. It is special to me. You see, when I just started down at the Jolly Fair, I was a young clown with no act. All the bigger clowns made fun of me.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1030">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>As they were professional comedians, you can imagine how their clever jokes were hurting me. I decided I needed to add a special feature to my show that could amaze them. A song and dance act that would impress everyone.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1031">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>It was therefore that I started manufacturing this very instrument, single-handedly. You’ll never believe how I made it.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1032">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>You went to the forest and looked for the tallest tree.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1033">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>You made it entirely out of candy.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1034">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>You tried to make a violin, but instead you ended up with a lute.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1035">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>You used dark magic to give it soporific power.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1036">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>No, I went to the forest and looked for the tallest tree. And from this giant’s timber, I sawed long, mighty planks. Twelve feet, these beauties were!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1037">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>Why was it necessary to have this kind of planks for a simple lute?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1038">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>I am a clown, Emmon. I use these gimmicks to perform my arts.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1039">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>But this lute seems to be rather normally sized.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1040">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Well… it just must have gotten smaller or something. You know how these things erode over time?</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1041">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I don’t believe a word you are saying.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1042">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Well, I am not giving the lute away for easy anyway. Benny wants something good in return.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1043">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>So what do you want for this lute? Maybe we can make a deal.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1044">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>As you can see, my clown shop is near perfection. Rarely so much fun was brought together in one place.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1045">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>However, lately I have heard about an item, which is missing from my collection, that can make me a lot of money - I mean, an article that would refine this place as a house of fun.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1046">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>Tell me more.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1047">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>It is called the Mask of Mockery. A mask with an insultingly mocking smile. Imagine the face of unsuspecting customers when they see me, wearing this tremendous mask. It will baffle them!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1048">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>Unfortunately the Mask of Mockery has been long lost. It is said the last wearer of the mask put it on and disappeared in the wilderness. But I am sure that it must be somewhere close!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1049">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>I will find this mask for you if you give me that lute in return!</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>

			<Text>The Tear Collector? Oh don’t get me started. His lust for tears has spoiled many of my best jokes. Bad company at birthdays.</Text>

		<SpokenLine ID="1066">
			<Speaker>Benny</Speaker>
			<Text>You mean Wally the Watcher? He never makes any trouble. The king must have a good reason for keeping you here in town.</Text>

		<SpokenLine ID="1069">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>
			<Text>Apparently the king is handing out obstruction quotas, giving every sentinel a fixed amount of people they have to stop before the end of the month.</Text>
			<DialogueType>BennyDialogue</DialogueType>
		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1070">
			<Speaker>Emmon</Speaker>

		</SpokenLine>
		<SpokenLine ID="1090">
